[TODO] - put constants in unused bitfields instead of always 0 (to put 1 as constant for INC & DEC)

[TODO] - add INC & DEC to isa.json

possibly :

[TODO] - rework registers syntax check -> exhaustive list of all supported registers indexes (array of nbrs) ?

[TODO] - warnings for overflowing program addresses & out-of-bonds addresses (including labels) ?

[TODO] - configurable instruction length (other than 32 bits) ?
